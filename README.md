# doug
code for our robot in vex v5 for competiton

essentially a backup/version control system

the version control is obvious, but heres a timeline

dougv1 - obsolete, refer to dougv2
         essentially made a bunch of functions then cobbled together a way for it to work
         doesn't function. like at all.

dougv2 - better, but still obsolete, refer to dougv3
         same as dougv1, but a looooot more readable.

dougv3 - current version.  if any major changes occur ill make a new file instead of editing v3
         this version allows for the robot to be driven with the joysticks, freeing up the buttons/bumpers for other things 
         (motors, pneumatics, etc)

dougv4/v5 - lost to time (and my filesystem)

dougv6 - PNEUMATICS YAY

dougv7 - removed intake - added a catapult.  also fixed controller inversion.

dougv8 - fully coded in the catapult
